## Relic Recommendation Algorithm

The `buildchar` command uses a heuristic algorithm to generate fully upgraded (Level 15, Rarity 5) relics for characters.

1.  **Set Selection**:
    *   **4-Piece Set** (Head, Hands, Body, Feet): Uses the primary recommended set from game data.
    *   **2-Piece Set** (Planar Sphere, Link Rope): Uses the primary recommended planar set from game data.
2.  **Main Affix Selection**:
    *   **Head**: HP
    *   **Hands**: ATK
    *   **Body/Feet/Sphere/Rope**: Selects the recommended property for that slot. Defaults to `HPAddedRatio` if no recommendation exists.
3.  **Sub-Affix Selection & Upgrade**:
    *   **Initialization**: Starts with the character's recommended sub-affix list from game data, removing the Main Affix if present.
    *   **Truncation**: If the list has more than 4 affixes, it keeps only the first 4.
    *   **Filling**: If the list has fewer than 4 affixes, it fills the remaining slots with the following priority until 4 slots are filled:
        1.  **Speed** and **Effect Resistance**.
        2.  **Delta Stats** (HP, ATK, DEF) if corresponding Ratio stats are present.
        3.  **Ratio Stats** (HP%, ATK%, DEF%) if not already present.
    *   **Enhancement**: The relic is simulated to have 5 random upgrades distributed among the *original recommended* sub-affixes (the "priority" affixes), ignoring any filled affixes.
